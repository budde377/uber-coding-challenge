# Transitastic
This app solves the problem *departure time* from the uber coding challenge, by gives real-time departure time for danish public transportation. The transit-information is aquired through the public available API of Rejseplanen.dk.

## The problem 


## The solution


## Demo
The application can be accessed at [http://christianbud.de:8000](http://christianbud.de:8000). Locations can be simulated by chaning location hash. E.g.

* Aarhus H: [http://christianbud.de:8000/#56150156/10204060/0](http://christianbud.de:8000/#56150156/10204060/0)
* Copenhagen H: [http://christianbud.de:8000/#55673063/12565796/0](http://christianbud.de:8000/#55673063/12565796/0)
* Ã…es (precision 2km): [http://christianbud.de:8000/#55918531/9968956/2000](http://christianbud.de:8000/#55918531/9968956/2000)


<!---
Create a service that gives real-time departure time for public transportation (use freely available public API). The app should geolocalize the user.

Regardless of whether it's your own code or our coding challenge, write your README as if it was for a production service. Include the following items:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or if it's full stack.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural. Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
* Link to your resume or public profile.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.
